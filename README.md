# Teach-a-Neural-Network-to-Read-Handwriting
Neural networks and deep learning are two success stories in modern artificial intelligence. They’ve led to major advances in image recognition, automatic text generation, and even in self-driving cars. To get involved with this exciting field, you should start with a manageable dataset. The **MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge** is the classic entry point. Image data is generally harder to work with than “flat” relational data. The MNIST data is beginner-friendly and is small enough to fit on one computer. Handwriting recognition will challenge you, but it doesn’t need high computational power. Build a neural network from scratch that solves the MNIST challenge with high accuracy. **Data Sources** **MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)** – MNIST is a modified subset of two datasets collected by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. It contains 70,000 labeled images of handwritten digits.
